# CVBS-Oscilloscope-Monitor

This repository is a KiCAD transcription of a circuit by Alan Wolfe.

## Description

The following circuit converts a composite signal and splits the signal as such that it can display video on analog-style oscilloscopes using X,Y & Z inputs.

## Features

- LED indicator - Used for monitoring power
- Power jacks/pads - choice between barrel jack or 3.96mm headers
- BNC connectors for inputs and outputs

- 2 flexable versions depending on users needs

## [THT](CVBS-Ossiliscope-Monitor/Releases/THT) Through Hole (Hand Soldering Version)

This version is simmaller to the equipmnet its intended to be used with as every single part is hand user replaceable simply fabricate the bare boards and order the parts acording the to BOM list.

## [SMD](CVBS-Ossiliscope-Monitor/Releases/SMD) Surface Mount (Factory Frabrication Version)

This version following modern fabrication standards is intended for ease of automated fabraication allowing drag and drop 1-2-3 ordering from services like PCBway or JLCPCB.
